# Tumour-diagnosis-using-AI
Using a real life cancer dataset to train an AI model to predict whether the tumor is malignant(cancerous) or benign(non-cancerous). 
The dataset contains the diagnosis field which has a value of 1(for malignant) and 0(for benign). Other fields include radius_mean, texture_mean, etc which describes the physical attributes of the tumor. 
We train an AI model with 80% of the data and test with 20% of the data. This model helps radiologists and oncologists diagnose cancer with ease.
At the end, we have tested our model with a custom input to check if the model works perfectly. Upon execution, the output is either 1 or 0 based on the prediction made by the model.


This project was made using the guidance of Khanrad's YouTube video titled "Make Your First AI in 15 Minutes with Python". The link to the video has been attached below.
